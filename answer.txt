a.) In an Agile environment, the product owner is essentially the leader of the team. They oversee the team's tasks and their development, and ensures that everyone on the team is able to complete their tasks in a timely and proficient manner. In a non-Agile environment like a waterfall methodology, the equivalent role to the product owner is the project manager.

b.) Scrum masters and product owners are overall similar in the sense that they both are overseeing roles that ensure the team is working up to speed. The differences are that the scrum master focuses more on being a source of knowledge on the team and directly helping them with issues if needed. The product owner focuses more on creating the product backlog, which the team will end up working on.
