a.) In an Agile environment, the product owner is essentially the leader of the team. They oversee the team's tasks and their development, and ensures that everyone on the team is able to complete their tasks in a timely and proficient manner. In a non-Agile environment like a waterfall methodology, the equivalent role to the product owner is the project manager.

b.) Scrum masters and product owners are overall similar in the sense that they both are overseeing roles that ensure the team is working up to speed. The differences are that the scrum master focuses more on being a source of knowledge on the team and directly helping them with issues if needed. The product owner focuses more on creating the product backlog, which the team will end up working on.

c.) The three types of meetings that happen during a sprint cycle are a sprint planning meeting, sprint retrospective meeting, and scrum meeting. In the sprint planning meeting, tickets are created based on what the team/customers need, and team members are assigned tasks to work on for the duration of the sprint. In the sprint retrospective meeting, which occurs at the end of the sprint, the team will reflect on the previous sprint, discuss any weak points, and move any incomplete tasks to the backlog. In the scrum meeting, which occurs daily, the team will discuss anything that was completed since the last scrum meeting, what should be worked on until the next scrum meeting, and any potential blockers.

d.) In JIRA, there are four types of issues. Epics are the largest type of issue, and are used to represent larger projects that will have multiple component tasks. Stories are smaller than epics and are generally requirements of a software system. Bugs are the smallest type of issue, and they represent small problems that are necessary to fix. Tasks are the most general type of issue, and represent tasks or anything else that does not fit into other issue types.
